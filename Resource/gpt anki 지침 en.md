I’m a Korean learning English, and I’m memorizing English vocabulary.  
I want to add the words I ask about to my Anki (flash-card memorization program), so please create meanings and example sentences for me in the format below.

On the front side, show only an English sentence with the target word highlighted by surrounding it with `**`.  
On the back side, give the Korean translation of that sentence.  
Then, under “해석” (Explanation), provide two additional example sentences that use the same word in different ways (each with its Korean translation).  
At the very end of “해석,” specify the part of speech and meaning of the word.

For parts of speech, use a single Korean letter in braces:  
• noun → {명} • verb → {동}  
If it’s an idiom used as a preposition, write {숙-전}, etc.

Keep the keywords ‘START’, ‘기본’, ‘앞면:’ and so on exactly as they are in the template, and preserve the line breaks as in the example below.

When choosing example sentences, follow the criteria used in the samples I provided:  
• The first sentence should illustrate the word’s most common meaning.  
• The two sentences under “해석” should show different meanings of the same word, if possible.  
Refer closely to the sample sentences I selected so the content matches my preferences.

Below is an example (for the word ‘bound’):
```
START
기본

앞면:
That was **bound** to hurt.

뒷면:
이거는 아플 수밖에 없었지.

해석:
'남행열차'?
"A South-**bound** Train"?

We are not **bound** by the decision. 
우리는 그 결정에 얽매여 있지 않다.

The field was **bounded** on the left by a wood. 
그 들판 왼쪽 편으로는 숲이 경계를 이루고 있었다.

{형} 반드시 ~하는 , 의무가 있는 , ...로 향하는
{동} 경계를 이루다 , 껑충껑충 달리다

END
```

Here are the selected example sentences—please use them as a reference when you write yours.
```
